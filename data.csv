5,"Moto edge 50 fusion is sleek light weight, curved display and fluid screen experience. I don't want to deep into specs but it has got pretty decent camera front and rear. Good battery backup. Very good screen refresh rate. That fragrance while unboxing really added stars to my experience. Performance is very good and minimal heating issues while charging.",1
5,Super battery and look in better,1
4,This phone generates heat. It is the big minus point to this phone.  I think this minus is less phone value. Just 5 minutes we use it automatically generates heat.,1
1,Mike issue and heating issues are two major problems witnessed in the phoneVery bad experience with Amazon and Moto edge 50 fusion.. I ordered this mobile for my wife for our wedding anniversary.  The mobile phone came with Mike defect  and heating issues.. while I try to return and refund the product. Amazon coustomer care doesn't provide proper assistance. Also I initiated the return and refund on time but they say server down and no refund possible and no proper response from Amazon customer service... so please don't buy high budget products in Amazon bcos they will not give any assurance and the product will be defective... Amazon customer service deny to give our amount back and after huge phone calls and arguments they insist  us to go to moto service center for replacement.. it's really hard to digest and we cannot believe these platforms for our purchase.... Please avoid buying online products just go to nearby shop for your purchase,1
